This assignment had me connect the given Client to my Server, and then reverse the strings being sent. 

No major issues held me up while working on this assignment. The code works as stated in the instructions and there are no functions implemented that can break. After taking a couple hours to pickup Python, it only took me around half an hour to complete the assignment itself. I first made sure the server accepted my arguments, then I had to figure out how to listen to the clients. After looping through each string sent and reversing it, I made sure to close the server and its sockets. Going over the class piazza and recitations resources helped to clarify project details and understand the Python syntax. The Server.py file was tested with additional source strings besides the given file, as well as being tested on separate ilab machines from the client, so there should not be significant problems with test cases
